A set of programms implementing algorithms on Subgroup Discovery under Treatment Effect.
The name of the library come from **SU**bgroup **DI**scovery under **T**reatment **E**ffect. Apparently in Russian the word SuDiTE is very close to "you judge". It is close to the goal of the library which is deciding which algorithm is the best one.
