\title{Predicts if an observation should be treated or not by means difference in predictions between two independent Random Forest models (Predict function for *train2MRF*)}
\usage{
predict2MRF(m, X, opts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a model trained with *train2MRF*}

\item{X}{is the covariate matrix}

\item{opts}{is a list of options (NOTE: fraction is one available option, it defines percent (from 0 to 1) of total observations with highest predicted PTE, which are then used in obtaining estimates of model performance)}
}
\value{
a binary vector specifying the observations to be treated
}
\description{
Predicts if an observation should be treated or not by means difference in predictions between two independent Random Forest models (Predict function for *train2MRF*)
}
\examples{

# Generating dataset
N = 1000
Trt = rbinom(N,1,0.5)
X = data.frame(X1=rbinom(N,1,0.6), X2=rnorm(N), X3=rnorm(N))
Y = as.numeric( ( 2*X$X1 - 1 + X$X2*Trt + rnorm(N) ) > 0 )
# Fitting model
m = train2MRF(Y, Trt, X, opts = list(Trt = list(mtry = 2, ntree = 15, nodesize = 200), Non_Trt = list(mtry = 2, ntree = 15, nodesize = 200)))
# Predicting a good group for new data, target is top 30\% observations with highest predicted PTE
predict2MRF(m, data.frame(X1=rbinom(1000,1,0.6), X2=rnorm(1000), X3=rnorm(1000)), opts = list(fraction = 0.3))
