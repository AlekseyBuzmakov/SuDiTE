\title{Predicts if an observation should be treated or not by means difference in predictions between two independent SVM models (Predict function for *train2MSVM*)}
\usage{
predict2MSVM(m, X, opts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a model trained with *train2MSVM*}

\item{X}{is the covariate matrix}

\item{opts}{is a list of options (NOTE: fraction is one available option, it defines percent (from 0 to 1) of total observations with highest predicted PTE, which are then used in obtaining estimates of model performance)}
}
\value{
a binary vector specifying the observations to be treated
}

\examples{

# Generating dataset
N = 1000
Trt = rbinom(N,1,0.5)
X = data.frame(X1=rbinom(N,1,0.6), X2=rnorm(N), X3=rnorm(N))
Y = as.numeric( ( 2*X$X1 - 1 + X$X2*Trt + rnorm(N) ) > 0 )
# Fitting model
m = train2MSVM(Y, Trt, X, opts = list(Trt = list(scale = F, kernel = "linear", subset = 0.5), Non_Trt = list(scale = T, kernel = "linear", subset = 0.3)))
# Predicting a good group for new data, target is top 30\% observations with highest predicted PTE
predict2MSVM(m, data.frame(X1=rbinom(1000,1,0.6), X2=rnorm(1000), X3=rnorm(1000)), opts = list(fraction = 0.3))
